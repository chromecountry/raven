# Sample Data for Testing

This directory contains sample data files for testing the receipt processing system.

## Files

### Bank Statements
- `sample_bank_statement.csv` - Standard format bank statement with 16 transactions
- `alternative_bank_statement.csv` - Alternative date format bank statement

### Receipts
- `receipts/` - Directory containing sample PDF receipts (generated by `generate_sample_pdfs.py`)

## Usage

### Generate Sample PDF Receipts
```bash
python generate_sample_pdfs.py
```

This will create 14 sample PDF receipts in the `receipts/` directory with realistic merchant names and amounts.

### Test Bank Statement Comparison
```bash
python bank_comparison.py sample_data/sample_bank_statement.csv
```

### Run Full System Test
```bash
python test_system.py
```

## CSV Format

The bank statement CSV files use this format:
```csv
Date,Description,Amount,Type
2024-01-15,WALMART SUPERCENTER,45.67,DEBIT
```

## PDF Receipts

The generated PDF receipts include:
- Merchant name
- Date and time
- Itemized breakdown
- Total amount
- Realistic formatting

## Testing Workflow

1. Generate sample PDFs: `python generate_sample_pdfs.py`
2. Test PDF parsing: `python test_system.py`
3. Compare with bank statements: `python bank_comparison.py sample_data/sample_bank_statement.csv`
4. Launch Fava: `python main.py launch-fava`
